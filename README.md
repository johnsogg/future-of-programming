# The Future of Programming? - Week by week

This is a week-by-week rundown of what we're doing. Given the experimental
nature of the class this will be made as we go.

[Looking for the syllabus?](SYLLABUS.md)

## Jan 13

1. [Make a journal (a Google slides deck) in our shared
   drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ffZHWLzqzBFL4z_9rktCp_hEKaNoXjpI?usp=drive_link).
   You'll need permission. See the section in the syllabus on 'our collective
   journals'.
2. If you're not already set up with a development environment, do that. If you
   need help, I've made a few [videos on getting set up with a Typescript
   stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f91OdNKQ1SE&list=PLAuBm-v5PQFd0yCKW7rJ4_CHFbBdBdie0).
3. For next week, use AI tools to see how far you can get solving my [Binary
   Search Tree homework assignment](https://github.com/johnsogg/bst) for the
   other class I'm teaching this semester. Try different approaches: in-editor
   plugins like [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or the
   [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)
   AI editors, or a [groq.com](https://groq.com) back-and-forth...
4. If the binary search tree thing went quickly, here's an open-ended,
   under-specified prompt: create an interactive application with colored balls
   moving around on the screen, bouncing off walls and each other. Any
   language/framework is OK.

## Jan 20: No class

MLK day!

## Jan 27

1. We will talk about how the Binary Search Tree and Bouncing Balls exercise
   went. Will pick a few people to take turns leading discussion based on your
   journal slides.
