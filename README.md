# The Future of Programming? - Week by week

This is a week-by-week rundown of what we're doing. Given the experimental
nature of the class this will be made as we go.

## Jan 13

1. Make a journal (a Google slides deck) in our shared drive. You'll need
   permission. See the section on 'our collective journals'.
2. If you're not already set up with a development environment, do that. If you
   need help, I've made a few [videos on getting set up with a Typescript
   stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f91OdNKQ1SE&list=PLAuBm-v5PQFd0yCKW7rJ4_CHFbBdBdie0).
3. For next week, use AI tools to see how far you can get solving my Binary
   Search Tree homework assignment for the other class I'm teaching this
   semester. Try different approaches: in-editor plugins like Copilot or the
   Cursor AI editor, or a [groq.com](https://groq.com) back-and-forth...
4. If the binary search tree thing went quickly, here's an open-ended,
   under-specified prompt: create an interactive application with colored balls
   moving around on the screen, bouncing off walls and each other.

## Jan 20: No class

MLK day!

## Jan 27

1. We will talk about how the Binary Search Tree and Bouncing Balls exercise
   went. Will pick a few people to take turns leading discussion based on your
   journal slides.
