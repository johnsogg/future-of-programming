# The Future of Programming? - Week by week

This is a week-by-week rundown of what we're doing. Given the experimental
nature of the class this will be made as we go.

[Looking for the syllabus?](SYLLABUS.md)

## Jan 13

1. [Make a journal (a Google slides deck) in our shared
   drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ffZHWLzqzBFL4z_9rktCp_hEKaNoXjpI?usp=drive_link).
   You'll need permission. See the section in the syllabus on 'our collective
   journals'.
2. If you're not already set up with a development environment, do that. If you
   need help, I've made a few [videos on getting set up with a Typescript
   stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f91OdNKQ1SE&list=PLAuBm-v5PQFd0yCKW7rJ4_CHFbBdBdie0).
3. In class, we will do a little exercise to see what is possible. We'll show
   how easy it is to work a data structures homework assignment without actually
   using your brain, and then you'll have a chance to do it as well. It will use
   this [linked list
   repository](https://github.com/johnsogg/typescript-linked-lists).
4. For next week, use AI tools to see how far you can get solving my [Binary
   Search Tree homework assignment](https://github.com/johnsogg/bst) for the
   other class I'm teaching this semester. Try different approaches: in-editor
   plugins like [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or the
   [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)
   AI editors, or a [groq.com](https://groq.com) back-and-forth...
5. If the binary search tree thing went quickly, here's an open-ended,
   under-specified prompt: create an interactive application with colored balls
   moving around on the screen, bouncing off walls and each other. Any
   language/framework is OK.

If you want inspiration for tools to try out, here is a [good blog post from a
non-developer's perspective on build products with
AI](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/a-guide-to-ai-prototyping-for-product).

## Jan 20: No class

MLK day!

## Jan 27

1. We will talk about how the Binary Search Tree and Bouncing Balls exercise
   went. Will pick a few people to take turns leading discussion based on your
   journal slides.
2. Friendly request regarding slides: we might present your slides in class so be sure they are legible in the back of the room. Big font, etc. Also, if your slides involve other resources be sure they are accessible to everyone without needing to request permission.

In class:

1. `N` show and tells for the first half of class before breaking. Remember to tell the story in a way everyone can understand, and slow down your live programming to give people a chance to absorb it.
2. After break we will do an exercise with a partner. Two options:
   1. one of you write a server, the other writes a client. They should communicate using a shared API. The server and client should be written in different languages. The overall system can be whatever you like: a game, a restaurant inventory system, an e-commerce thing, whatever.
   2. (intentionally hard) Programming in English: writing nothing but English prose, write a simplified clone of your favorite retro video game. This can include prose descriptions of image assets, sounds, interaction design, data structures, input controls, etc.
3. For homework, either
   1. Do the in-class exercise that you didn't do. _Write down what you intend to do before you start._ This is so you can determine if you achieved your goal, or if you just floated with the wind and happened to make a cool thing. Also, wrap it up with some level of polish so it is coherently presentable.
   2. Or, read the [DeepSeek R1 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948). Either way, be prepared to present/discuss it next time.
